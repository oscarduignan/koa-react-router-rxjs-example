# koa-react-router-rxjs-example
Getting my head around Koa, React, RxJS, ReactRouter and how these can fit together in an "isomorphic" (so components are rendered on the server initially) app - at the moment it's just the server part of this (koa routing requests with react router and loading data with rxjs)

```
npm install
npm run app
```

check out [server.js](https://github.com/oscarduignan/koa-react-router-rxjs-example/blob/master/server.js) for the "heavy" lifting.
